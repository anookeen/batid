<p>Welcome to BatID. This software will enable you to quickly and easily identify 
the species associated with bat calls recorded using Anabat or Songmeter bat 
detectors. The current version of BatID is 1.1.</p>

<p>In order to get started, please read and follow the installation instructions 
below.</p>

<h1>
<a name="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h1>

<p>BatID requires that your computer have a working installation of Python 2.x 
available, as well as several packages for scientific computing, including 
numpy, matplotlib, and skikit-learn v0.12.</p>

<p>To easily install everything that you need, simply follow these three steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you are reading this on github.com, download the entire BatID package by 
going to <a href="https://github.com/jkitzes/batid/zipball/master">https://github.com/jkitzes/batid/zipball/master</a>. This will download 
a zip file, which you can double-click to expand. This folder contains the 
BatID software.</p></li>
<li><p>Install the Enthought Free python distribution. Download and install 
Enthought Free from <a href="http://www.enthought.com/products/epd_free.php">http://www.enthought.com/products/epd_free.php</a> (you'll 
need to fill out the form at the bottom of the page, which will take you 
directly to a download link). If you are running Linux, chose the 32-bit 
version.</p></li>
<li><p>Install sklearn v0.12. If you are using Windows, go to 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/scikit-learn/files/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/scikit-learn/files/</a>, download the file 
scikit-learn-0.12.win32-py2.7.exe, and run it. If you are using a Mac, 
simply go to the BatID folder that you have downloaded (the folder 
containing this README file), where you will see a subfolder called 'src'. 
Open this subfolder, and change the name of the folder 'xsklearn' to 
'sklearn'.</p></li>
</ol><p>Once you have completed these steps, you can double-click on the Run_BatID file 
(on Windows) or the Run_BatID_Mac file (on a Mac) to launch the application. 
The application itself runs in your web browser - however, all analysis and 
data remain on your own computer, and no information is sent across the 
internet at any time.</p>

<p>If you are on a Mac, it's possible that you will receive an error the first 
time you double-click on Run_BatID_Mac. If so, try again - the program should 
launch on the second try.</p>

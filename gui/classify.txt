<h1>Classify Bat Calls</h1>

<form method='get' action='run'>

<h3>1. Choose an Anabat scan file</h3>
See the <a href="instructions">Instruction page</a> for information on how to create this file. If you'd like to test the classifier, you can choose the file <b>demo-aml.txt</b> from the <b>demo</b> directory located in the BatID folder.

	<p>
	<b>File location:</b> <br />
	<input type=text name="filepath" value="$message1" />
		<span class="small"><a href="classify?get_file=True" class="white button">Browse</a></span>
	</p>

<h3>2. Select region</h3>
Different classifiers are available for different geographic regions. In general, you should choose the smallest region that applies to your data (e.g., choose SF Bay instead of California if possible). More information about the reference calls used to fit each classifier can be found in the <a href="instructions">About page</a>.

	<p>
	<b>Region:</b> <br />
	<input type=radio name="classifier" value="class-sfbay.pkl" /> SF Bay Area<br />
	<input type=radio name="classifier" value="class-calif.pkl" /> California
	</p>
	
<h3>3. Select a quality threshold for calls</h3>
Anabat assigns each call a qual score between zero and one, with lower scores indicating a higher quality recording. Calls with a qual value below the threshold below will be classified, and calls with a qual value above the threshold below will be ignored. To include all recorded calls, set this parameter to 1. A value of 0.3 is suggested.

	<p>
	<b>Qual Threshold:</b> <br />
	<input type=text name="maxqual"/>
	</p>

<h3>4. Select criteria for identifying a pass</h3>
The settings below allow the classification of passes to be made more or less stringent. A pass will be classified as a given species only if there are a minimum number of individual calls in a pass that are each classified with a minimum percentage certainty of being from that species. Note that it is possible, if these settings are lenient, that a given pass may be classified as more than one species. Values of 1 for the minimum number of calls and 0.9 for the minimum percentage percentage certainty are reasonable starting points.

		<p>
		<b>Minimum number of calls:</b> <br />
		<input type=text name="mincalls"/>
		</p>

		<p>
		<b>Minimum Percentage Certainty (enter as a fraction):</b> <br />
		<input type=text name="minprob"/>
		</p>

<h3>5. Run Classifier</h3>
Please only click the Classify button once. It may take several minutes for your analysis to complete. The classifier will create and save several files in the same directory where your scan file is located. For a description of these files, see the <a href="about">About</a> page.

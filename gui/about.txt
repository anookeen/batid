<h1 class="post-title">About BatID</h1>

BatID 1.1 is free, open source software to help users identify the species associated with bat calls recored using Anabat, Songmeter, or other similar detectors.

<h2 class="post-title">Accuracy and other disclaimers</h2>

<p><b>DISCLAIMER:</b> BatID is is no way 100% accurate at identifying bat calls! The overall accuracy of identified calls is approximately 82% (ie, 82% of known calls are identified correctly), and the overall accuracy of identified passes is approximately 88% using the "maxprob" method (see below). Please keep this in mind if the classifier indicates only a few instances of a rare species. For example, if the classifier states that you have 1,000 Brazilian free-tailed calls and 10 Townsend's big eared bat calls, it is possible that these 10 Townsend's calls would arise by chance simply by mis-classifying such a large number of free-tailed calls. The classifier can be made more stringent, helping to avoid such misclassification issues for rare species, by modifying the minimum call number and minimum percentage certainty parameters on the classification page.</p>

<h2 class="post-title">What it does</h2>

<p>When you run the BatID classifiers on a Anabat scan file (see <a href="instructions">the instructions page</a> for information on how to create this file), several results files will be saved in the same directory where the scan file is located:</p>

<p>
<ul>
	<li><b>call_prob.csv</b> - a table containing each individual recorded call, and the probability that it was made by each species found in the classifier</li>
	<li><b>call_bin.csv</b> - a table similar to that in call_prob, with with a "binary" classification for each call in which each call is assigned to the species with the highest probability of having made it</li>
	<li><b>pass_prob.csv</b> - a table similar to call_prob.csv, but with each row corresponding to a single bat pass (ie, a single recording file) instead of to individual calls within passes. The probabilities in this table are just the sums of the probabilities for all calls within a pass.</li>
	<li><b>pass_maxprob.csv</b> - a table similar to call_bin.csv, but constructed for passes instead of calls (the binary classification is based on the species with the highest mean probability across all calls in that pass)</li>
	<li><b>pass_maxprob.csv</b> - a table in which passes are classified as a species only if the minimum call number and minimum percentage certainty parameters are met for a species</li>
	<li><b>scanfilename-clean.csv</b> - a cleaned and formatted version of the scan file</li>
	<li><b>config.cfg</b> - a configuration file that saves the options that you chose on the BatID classifier page</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2 class="post-title">How it works</h2>

<p>The process of identifying calls with the BatID software begins with the construction of a bat call classifier. BatID uses random forest classifiers that are trained on calls that were made by known, expert identified species. By examining the various parameters associated with the calls made from each species, the classifier "learns" how to distinguish calls to the species level. For example, the classifier may learn that any calls with a characteristic frequency at or above 50 kHz belong to either Yuma or California myotis, and no other species. This, and other similar discriminating factors, are used to identify calls made by unknown species.</p>
	
<p>The California and San Francisco classifiers use calls collected and generously shared by William Rainey. </p>

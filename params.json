{"name":"Batid","tagline":"Free open source bat call identification","body":"Introduction\r\n============\r\n\r\nWelcome to BatID. This software will enable you to quickly and easily identify \r\nthe species associated with bat calls recorded using Anabat or Songmeter bat \r\ndetectors. The current version of BatID is 1.1.\r\n\r\nIn order to get started, please read and follow the installation instructions \r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nBatID requires that your computer have a working installation of Python 2.x \r\navailable, as well as several packages for scientific computing, including \r\nnumpy, matplotlib, and skikit-learn v0.12.\r\n\r\nTo easily install everything that you need, simply follow these three steps:\r\n\r\n1. If you are reading this on github.com, download the entire BatID package by \r\n   going to https://github.com/jkitzes/batid/zipball/master. This will download \r\n   a zip file, which you can double-click to expand. This folder contains the \r\n   BatID software.\r\n\r\n2. Install the Enthought Free python distribution. Download and install \r\n   Enthought Free from http://www.enthought.com/products/epd_free.php (you'll \r\n   need to fill out the form at the bottom of the page, which will take you \r\n   directly to a download link). If you are running Linux, chose the 32-bit \r\n   version.\r\n\r\n3. Install sklearn v0.12. If you are using Windows, go to \r\n   http://sourceforge.net/projects/scikit-learn/files/, download the file \r\n   scikit-learn-0.12.win32-py2.7.exe, and run it. If you are using a Mac, \r\n   simply go to the BatID folder that you have downloaded (the folder \r\n   containing this README file), where you will see a subfolder called 'src'. \r\n   Open this subfolder, and change the name of the folder 'xsklearn' to \r\n   'sklearn'.\r\n\r\nOnce you have completed these steps, you can double-click on the Run_BatID file \r\n(on Windows) or the Run_BatID_Mac file (on a Mac) to launch the application. \r\nThe application itself runs in your web browser - however, all analysis and \r\ndata remain on your own computer, and no information is sent across the \r\ninternet at any time.\r\n\r\nIf you are on a Mac, it's possible that you will receive an error the first \r\ntime you double-click on Run_BatID_Mac. If so, try again - the program should \r\nlaunch on the second try.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthor\r\n======\r\n\r\nThis software was written by Justin Kitzes <jkitzes@berkeley.edu>.
